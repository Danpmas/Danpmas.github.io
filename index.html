                        <p1>Welcome to my website! As I seek job opportunities, I am excited about the prospect of contributing to 
                        real-world tech scenarios and delving into my second career. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to 
                        delve into AI and machine learning algorithms, contribute to large-scale data analysis,
                        and software engineering projects. With a commitment to continuous learning and a keen eye for detail, I am ready to take 
                        on challenges and add value to any team.

                                The data visualizations were compared to simulation runs of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model.
