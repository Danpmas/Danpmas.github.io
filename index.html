        <p>Welcome to my website! As I seek internship opportunities, I am excited about the prospect of contributing to 
            and learning from real-world tech scenarios. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to 
            develop innovative software solutions, delve into AI and machine learning algorithms, contribute to large-scale data analysis,
            and build robust security systems. With a commitment to continuous learning and a keen eye for detail, I am ready to take 
            on challenges and add value to any team.

                <p>I created a weighted graph of websites and persistently stored it the edges in a text file. I then used Djikstra's algorithm
                    to find the shortest path between one website to another. I also displayed the number of disjoint sets, as well as the websites
                    present in each disjoint set.</p>
